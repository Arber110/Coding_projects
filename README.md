# Coding_projects
# the following repository houses a variety of personal programming projects by Arber Hoxha
# this README file contains a short description on all the programs in this repository :)

# Is_it_strong.py
  # this is a simple password checker that uses more advanced data algorithms to analyze and estimate the strength of a password based on a generated list of the most common passwords used in 2025
  # The program uses a string search algorithm to idenitfy patterns in the entered string password and depending on the patterns found in the entered password and then estimates how long a computer could take to break into the password (via brute force)
  # The program also offeres a little twist in its desired puprose towards the end and offers some tips and recommendations on password generation, use, and strength
